## create a HashSet.
searching the data that randomly generated in HashSet and count duplicate items in the HashSet.
Ex. repeatedly calls the random number generator method and stores the numbersit generates in a HashSet. Use the contains method of a HashSet to see if thatnumber has already been generated that someone already has thisbirthday). If so, increment a counter that tracks how many times that at least twopeople have the same birthday.


## part 2.
run the simulateRoom method numberOfSimulations times,passing in numberOfPeople as a parameter. Keep a running total of how manybirthday collisions are reported by simulateRoom, then store (in a float) the result ofdividing that total by numberOfSimulations.
That means For [numberOfPeople] people, the probability of a birthday collision is[probability].
